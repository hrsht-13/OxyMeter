> The **Navigation Bar** on the top left corner has been added to access different pages.
> Dashboard is created using PowerBI.
> Distribution of various features are shown.
> Some important ranges are mentioned which helped to categorize the dataset.
> Modeling is done with the help of PyCaret. 
> Error analysis shows the deviation of the predicted values from the actual ones. 
> RMSE has been used as the main metric to optimize LGMReressor.
